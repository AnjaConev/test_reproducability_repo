# Acute Myeloid Leukemia Heatmap

This repository contains an analysis of an [acute myeloid leukemia sample dataset](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP070849) from [Shih et al., 2017](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/28193779/), pre-processed by [refinebio](https://www.refine.bio/). The data includes RNA-sequencing results for 19 samples obtained from acute myeloid leukemia (AML) model mice under controlled treatment conditions. The dataset can be [downloaded from refine.bio](https://www.refine.bio/experiments/SRP070849), already processed and quantile normalized.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites

This project is written in R. If you don't have R installed yet, you can get it [here](https://www.r-project.org/).

You will also need to install the following R packages if you have not installed them already:

- `pheatmap`: for clustering and creating a heatmap.
- `magrittr`: for pipe operations (`%>%`).

You can install these packages using the following commands in your R console:
```r
install.packages("pheatmap")
install.packages("magrittr")
```

### Installing

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your-repository.git
```

### Directory Structure

The project has the following structure:

- `data`: This directory contains the data files.
- `plots`: This directory will contain the plots generated by the script.
- `results`: This directory will contain the results generated by the script.

## Running the Analysis

To run the analysis, open the R script in RStudio and click on the "Source" button.

The script performs the following steps:

1. Set up analysis folders (`data`, `plots`, and `results`).
2. Define the file paths to the data and metadata files.
3. Install and load the required R packages.
4. Import and set up the data and metadata.
5. Choose genes of interest based on variance.
6. Prepare the metadata for annotation.
7. Create an annotated heatmap using the `pheatmap` function.
8. Save the annotated heatmap as a PNG file.

## Session Info

For reproducibility purposes, the session information, including the version of R and all packages loaded in the script, is included at the end of the script.
